I meet some trouble when using the node.js to save message in function.
So I have to use user.json to save json data temperately.
Just temperatelyï¼Œthe data has been saved into the database.
And I find there is a bug in the netlify but it is no problem in my local address.
It is too difficult to fix it. I think it may because the file operation.
The data from the database may not appear in https://1155181315-asg4-eclt5830.netlify.app.
But it could appear in the production mode.
All the function has been finished.
